00:00:01.203 --> 00:00:02.731
Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:02.732 --> 00:00:04.019
The cure to vampirism.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.461
I knew you
wanted it for Elena.

4
00:00:05.462 --> 00:00:06.806
What if I don't want
it for her now?

5
00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:09.495
If anyone tries to flip
my humanity switch back on,

6
00:00:09.496 --> 00:00:10.967
I'll become
your worst nightmare.

7
00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:13.868
Ty, stop!

8
00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:16.595
Hello, mother.

9
00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:18.496
You believe
that I can reconnect Stefan

10
00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.364
with his humanity.

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.965
And once we've done that,

12
00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:23.900
then we will go
rescue my friends?

13
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:27.368
They were known as heretics,
vampires with witch power.

14
00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.101
That woman
made me a monster

15
00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:30.289
and then abandoned me.

16
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.280
Who's that?

17
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:34.078
Damon's lame attempt
to get my humanity back on.

18
00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.247
And let me guess... then
you get my humanity back on.

19
00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:37.450
I don't think so.

20
00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:41.285
I will never leave you again.

21
00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.158
Mother.

22
00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.693
You have to go
after Caroline.

23
00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:50.060
I'll find her.

25
00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.747
Aw. An angel.

26
00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:06.983
- How cute is this place?
- Adorable.

27
00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:08.585
Ok. So I'll bite.

28
00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:09.919
So you hunt me down in a bar,

29
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.387
where I am perfectly
content feeding

30
00:01:11.388 --> 00:01:12.722
on the wait staff

31
00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:15.558
so you can whine to me
about how your mom is a bitch...

32
00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:17.227
What kind of mother doesn't
love her own children?

33
00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:20.543
Whatever.
So she spun you a web of lies

34
00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:22.899
and couldn't flip
your humanity switch back on,

35
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.470
and now you want to eat people,
which I am totally down for.

36
00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:32.241
So... what the hell are we doing
in a B&B in Grove Hill?

37
00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:36.479
Well, I figure we could
take a little break.

38
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.282
Ohhh.

39
00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:40.715
Duh.

40
00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:43.286
Stefan, voice-over:
First step... convince her

41
00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:45.221
that my humanity is still off.

42
00:01:45.222 --> 00:01:47.190
I'll tell her that my run-in with
our mother had no effect on me

43
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:48.661
and I want to keep
the party going.

44
00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:51.582
Ah. Look at that.
St. Stefan has a plan.

45
00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:53.396
Let me guess...
Whoever's holding the kitten

46
00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:55.231
gets to talk
about their feelings.

47
00:01:55.232 --> 00:01:57.567
Torture her until she breaks.

48
00:01:57.568 --> 00:01:58.868
Sold.

49
00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.236
So do I need to
remind you two that

50
00:02:00.237 --> 00:02:01.804
the last time Caroline thought

51
00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:03.072
that we were trying
to flip her switch

52
00:02:03.073 --> 00:02:05.141
she went on a killing spree?

53
00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:06.841
Well, she's not gonna
find out this time.

54
00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:10.079
Who are you calling?

55
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.948
Hey. Can I get some towels
sent up to the room, please?

56
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:14.650
Thank you.

57
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:16.318
I'm hungry,
so I figure we can eat

58
00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.687
whoever brings them up.

59
00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:20.922
See?
He'll be convincing.

60
00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:23.425
Fine. Say she believes you.

61
00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:25.193
How do you know she's gonna
even want to see you again?

62
00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:26.829
Oh, she'll want to see him.

63
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.998
Damon, shut up.

64
00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.633
I mean, it's a bit of a tricky
bet for you, isn't it, brother?

65
00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:32.334
She's gonna expect a lot.

66
00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:34.036
Ok. What am I missing here?

67
00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:35.137
Nothing.

68
00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:36.205
Hang on a second.

69
00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:39.575
- Did you and Caroline...
- Do it? Yep.

70
00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.977
Oh. This was
after she flipped...

71
00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:43.712
Never mind.

72
00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:45.214
It's not exactly how
I wanted things to go down,

73
00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:47.255
but I can't change it now,
so can we just drop it?

74
00:02:47.256 --> 00:02:50.285
Ok. Sore subject.
Understood.

75
00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:52.154
So what do we do once
you earn her trust?

76
00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:53.488
We drain her of her blood,

77
00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.790
make her weak,
and then bombard her

78
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:56.124
with everything
she used to care about...

79
00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:59.695
Memories of who she was,
her friendships, her mom.

80
00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:02.154
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

81
00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:04.466
What is that?

82
00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.001
Caroline got rid of everything
from her former life.

83
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:07.536
Her mom had sent this letter,

84
00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:08.904
intending for it to arrive
after she died,

85
00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.039
which it did,

86
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.642
but Caroline had already
flipped her switch.

87
00:03:13.643 --> 00:03:14.943
It could work.

88
00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.511
Sure. Unless she wants
sexy Stefan time

89
00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.413
instead of an assault
on memory lane.

90
00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:20.147
I'm not gonna let that happen.

91
00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:25.620
Now what are you doing?

92
00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:28.323
Just making us some drinks.

93
00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:30.558
- Such a gentleman.
- Hmm.

94
00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.364
Dinner.

95
00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.093
Towels!

96
00:03:47.142 --> 00:03:49.344
Sure you want to do this?

97
00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:51.446
Let's just get it over with.

99
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.294
Stefan?

100
00:04:06.295 --> 00:04:07.762
Yeah.

101
00:04:07.763 --> 00:04:09.530
What happened?

102
00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:11.065
We got caught.

103
00:04:13.768 --> 00:04:15.336
Hello.

104
00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:17.538
Hey. This is a surprise.

105
00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.006
Well, you know, I was
just in the hood.

106
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:20.208
I thought I might
stop by and bring

107
00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.375
my friend a little
morning pick-me-up.

108
00:04:21.376 --> 00:04:23.578
Thanks.
What is this?

109
00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:25.113
Uh, it's a mocha
latte frappasomethin'.

110
00:04:25.114 --> 00:04:26.614
I don't know.
I guessed.

111
00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:28.482
Clearly. So Elena told me that

112
00:04:28.483 --> 00:04:30.518
you guys found Caroline,
which is great.

113
00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:31.686
Funny enough, she didn't mention

114
00:04:31.687 --> 00:04:33.353
anything about a cure
for vampirism?

115
00:04:33.355 --> 00:04:35.056
Please don't tell me
you said anything.

116
00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:37.825
I didn't. Apparently,
neither have you.

117
00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:38.993
Well, yeah. Look.
I've been busy, you know?

118
00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:40.027
My mom's in town.

119
00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:42.530
I had to vampire-proof a B&B.

120
00:04:42.531 --> 00:04:43.798
Do you have any idea
how many people

121
00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:45.265
I had to compel
to make that happen?

122
00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:46.567
Quite a few I am assuming,

123
00:04:46.568 --> 00:04:48.402
which makes me wonder
how you had time

124
00:04:48.403 --> 00:04:50.905
to bring your bud a coffee, hmm?

125
00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:53.908
You ever hear of april lyrids?

126
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.976
Yeah, me neither.
Anyway, it's a stupid comet

127
00:04:55.977 --> 00:04:57.411
that my mom thinks
that she's gonna use

128
00:04:57.412 --> 00:04:59.079
to pull her friends out
of the 1903 prison world.

129
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.982
Ok, but we're not
letting her people out.

130
00:05:01.983 --> 00:05:04.318
Well, I may have
reinforced that possibility

131
00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.421
when I gave the ascendant
to her for safekeeping.

132
00:05:07.422 --> 00:05:08.866
You what?!

133
00:05:09.924 --> 00:05:11.190
Come here.

134
00:05:12.593 --> 00:05:14.595
Damon, you were the one
that said her friends

135
00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:16.430
are vampires who can do magic.

136
00:05:16.431 --> 00:05:18.298
I think the PC term
is witchpire.

137
00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:21.068
The term is freaks we've
never dealt with before.

138
00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.603
But it doesn't matter
because she still needs you

139
00:05:22.604 --> 00:05:25.339
to do the spell to open up
the door to 1903, Bonnie.

140
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.040
Oh. So that means she's
gonna come looking for me.

141
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:28.342
So we stall her.

142
00:05:28.343 --> 00:05:30.510
Look. Lily's like
a bill collector.

143
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:33.446
You dodge her calls long enough,
she'll leave you alone.

144
00:05:33.448 --> 00:05:36.153
No. Eventually,
they shut your power off.

145
00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:40.921
You better fix this
before she becomes my problem.

146
00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:43.789
And don't ever show up here
pretending to care about me again!

147
00:05:48.028 --> 00:05:49.963
Oh. Did I tell you?

148
00:05:49.964 --> 00:05:52.999
I got us into that cute
bakery right off campus.

149
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.035
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

150
00:05:55.036 --> 00:05:58.201
To taste wedding cake
for our wedding.

151
00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:59.705
Oh.

152
00:05:59.707 --> 00:06:01.575
I don't need to remind you.

153
00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:02.676
Right around the corner.

154
00:06:02.677 --> 00:06:04.110
Is this where I pretend to care

155
00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:05.700
about how
our wedding cake tastes?

156
00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:07.441
I just pulled
a rummy all-nighter

157
00:06:07.442 --> 00:06:09.849
at a B&B we're supposed to
be scouting for the wedding.

158
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.552
You can care about cake.

159
00:06:12.553 --> 00:06:14.688
Did I mention
that the cute bakery

160
00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:17.189
is right next door to
an even cuter Tequila bar?

161
00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:20.360
Mmm. Tequila.
My favorite.

162
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:21.861
Gin. Again.

163
00:06:21.862 --> 00:06:23.429
How many is that?

164
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:34.274
Oh! Um, ahem.

165
00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:36.809
Elena! Hey.

166
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.845
We were just keeping a really
close eye on your friends.

167
00:06:38.846 --> 00:06:40.380
Yeah. Real close.

168
00:06:40.381 --> 00:06:42.047
Yeah. I can see that.

169
00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:43.549
Yeah.

170
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.451
Good news!
Your shift's over.

171
00:06:45.452 --> 00:06:47.086
I'm here to relieve you.

172
00:06:47.087 --> 00:06:50.188
In that case, I'm just gonna
head to the honeymoon suite.

173
00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:53.493
Ahem.

174
00:06:53.494 --> 00:06:55.261
Uh, supplies are right here.

175
00:06:55.262 --> 00:06:58.312
Uh, cards are right there
just in case you get bored.

176
00:06:58.313 --> 00:06:59.887
Supplies, cards, got it.

177
00:06:59.888 --> 00:07:01.701
Yeah. Great.
So we'll see you in a few hours.

178
00:07:01.702 --> 00:07:04.804
- Ric?
- Yeah?

179
00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:07.473
It's really nice to
see you happy.

180
00:07:07.474 --> 00:07:10.042
Oh, thanks.

181
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:13.813
I think they're awake, so...

182
00:07:13.814 --> 00:07:16.549
Have fun with that.

183
00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.052
Phew. Ok.

184
00:07:21.054 --> 00:07:23.555
Err! Ohh!

185
00:07:26.092 --> 00:07:30.529
They vampire-proofed a B&B.

186
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.132
How did they even know
we were here?

187
00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:34.799
Why are you so calm?

188
00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:36.001
Help me.

189
00:07:36.002 --> 00:07:37.470
Because I already tried.

190
00:07:37.471 --> 00:07:39.638
You're wasting your energy.

191
00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:41.807
Ugh. Every move
I make feels like

192
00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:45.077
sandpaper rubbing
against my veins.

193
00:07:45.078 --> 00:07:46.377
They're drying us out.

194
00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:49.415
First they drain our blood,
then they starve us.

195
00:07:49.416 --> 00:07:53.085
I know how desiccation
works, Stefan.

196
00:07:53.086 --> 00:07:55.687
Ah-ah. I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

197
00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:57.990
I can literally feel

198
00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:00.125
my cells shrinking.

199
00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:02.561
You do realize that vodka

200
00:08:02.562 --> 00:08:04.830
to a desiccating vampire is
like salt water to a human?

201
00:08:04.831 --> 00:08:06.365
What's with the lecture?

202
00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:09.800
Just shut up
and let me enjoy this.

203
00:08:12.437 --> 00:08:14.139
Knock, knock.

204
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.174
Elena.
Let me guess...

205
00:08:16.175 --> 00:08:20.145
Humanity police was your idea.

206
00:08:20.146 --> 00:08:22.614
We really want you
back, Caroline.

207
00:08:22.615 --> 00:08:25.350
Remember that time Jeremy died
and you turned off your humanity

208
00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:27.018
and tried to kill
the prom queen,

209
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.554
aka your best friend Bonnie?

210
00:08:29.555 --> 00:08:31.823
I forget.
Stefan, was that before or after

211
00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:34.326
she killed some
waitress for no reason?

212
00:08:34.327 --> 00:08:35.726
I think it was after.

213
00:08:35.728 --> 00:08:38.863
Heh. You see,
Stefan and I are just finding it

214
00:08:38.865 --> 00:08:41.633
a little ironic that you think

215
00:08:41.634 --> 00:08:43.168
you're qualified
to tell us how to deal

216
00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.537
with the death of a loved one.

217
00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:48.157
I'm not here
to preach to you, Caroline.

218
00:08:48.158 --> 00:08:51.543
I just came to show you this.

219
00:08:51.544 --> 00:08:53.945
This letter from your mom
arrived at our dorm

220
00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:55.513
just a few days
after her funeral.

221
00:08:55.514 --> 00:08:58.315
Apparently there was something
she wanted to tell you.

222
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.758
Does this look real to you?

223
00:09:10.628 --> 00:09:13.031
Her impeccably
perfect handwriting?

224
00:09:13.032 --> 00:09:15.733
Yep. I remember
when she taught me

225
00:09:15.734 --> 00:09:17.768
how to write my name in cursive.

226
00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:23.608
So what,
am I supposed to read this

227
00:09:23.609 --> 00:09:27.806
and snap back to sad,
pathetic, motherless Caroline?

228
00:09:29.882 --> 00:09:32.096
- Burn it.
- What?

229
00:09:32.475 --> 00:09:34.685
Did I say,
"stand there and look stupid"?

230
00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:38.189
No. I said, "burn it."

231
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.626
Well, maybe I should
read it first.

232
00:09:41.627 --> 00:09:43.493
Why do you care?

233
00:09:43.495 --> 00:09:45.963
I mean, what happens if eventually
you get your humanity back

234
00:09:45.964 --> 00:09:47.732
and you hate me for
destroying the last thing

235
00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:49.500
your mom wanted to say to you?

236
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:52.803
Did those words seriously
just come out of your mouth?

237
00:09:52.804 --> 00:09:54.237
God!

238
00:09:57.775 --> 00:09:58.943
Burn it!

239
00:09:58.944 --> 00:10:00.077
Now!

240
00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:01.544
Stefan, don't!

241
00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:14.557
No!

242
00:10:17.628 --> 00:10:20.096
Sorry, Elena,

243
00:10:20.098 --> 00:10:21.599
but if you want us back,

244
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.274
you're gonna have to try
a lot harder than that.

245
00:10:51.006 --> 00:10:52.305
Hey, Matt.

246
00:10:52.306 --> 00:10:54.307
Hey. Can I assume
that the woman who looks like

247
00:10:54.308 --> 00:10:55.675
she's never been
in a restaurant before

248
00:10:55.676 --> 00:10:57.210
is your lunch date?

249
00:10:57.211 --> 00:10:58.944
Great. She's early.

250
00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:00.713
So what do you want me to do?

251
00:11:00.714 --> 00:11:02.181
Just wait 10 minutes,

252
00:11:02.182 --> 00:11:03.416
tell her I'm running late,
and stall her

253
00:11:03.417 --> 00:11:04.751
till I find what I need.

254
00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:06.118
Ok.

255
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.492
Thought you were off
learning to be a sheriff.

256
00:11:13.493 --> 00:11:14.727
Thanks to Stefan and Caroline,

257
00:11:14.728 --> 00:11:15.995
I can barely tie
my shoe at the moment.

258
00:11:15.996 --> 00:11:17.363
What, are you here
to stalk someone?

259
00:11:17.364 --> 00:11:19.799
I'm through with all that.

260
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.069
I've decided a direct approach
is best.

261
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.870
One of your diners
owes me some answers.

262
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:26.372
I can't have any
trouble in here, man.

263
00:11:26.373 --> 00:11:29.474
That will depend on how
this conversation goes.

264
00:11:32.111 --> 00:11:33.979
I know you.

265
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.748
You came to my house
a few days ago.

266
00:11:35.749 --> 00:11:38.184
Yes, and as chance
would have it,

267
00:11:38.185 --> 00:11:42.188
your son and I are old friends.

268
00:11:42.189 --> 00:11:43.855
My God.

269
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:48.160
Lorenzo.
It's you.

270
00:11:48.161 --> 00:11:50.996
So you two know each other?

271
00:11:50.997 --> 00:11:53.766
The phrase "small world"
comes to mind.

272
00:11:53.767 --> 00:11:55.733
So does "epic understatement."

273
00:11:57.771 --> 00:11:59.972
Uh, my lunch companion
has yet to arrive.

274
00:11:59.973 --> 00:12:04.042
- Won't you join me for a drink?
- Don't mind if I do.

275
00:12:07.646 --> 00:12:09.414
She burned the letter.

276
00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:11.216
That was my ace in the hole.

277
00:12:11.217 --> 00:12:12.663
I blew it.

278
00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:15.821
Look.

279
00:12:15.822 --> 00:12:17.789
The fact that you suck
at torturing people

280
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.891
is nothing to be ashamed of.

281
00:12:21.627 --> 00:12:23.127
That's why you have me.

282
00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:24.329
Well, at least Alaric
and Jo can cross this

283
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.931
off their list
of honeymoon options.

284
00:12:26.933 --> 00:12:28.000
They have a list?

285
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:30.035
Mm-hmm. Jo's pregnant.

286
00:12:30.036 --> 00:12:31.603
They didn't want to
have to fly anywhere?

287
00:12:31.604 --> 00:12:33.071
Do you have a list?

288
00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:35.140
Of where I'd go
on my fictional honeymoon

289
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:36.775
before I give birth
to my fictional baby?

290
00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:37.876
No.

291
00:12:37.877 --> 00:12:39.878
But not here.

292
00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:41.713
I thought you liked this place.

293
00:12:41.714 --> 00:12:42.848
Really?

294
00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:44.349
What part of extreme
floral patterns

295
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.884
screams Elena Gilbert to you?

296
00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:47.085
Well, excuse me, missy.

297
00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:48.887
I guess we've never played

298
00:12:48.888 --> 00:12:50.989
the let's pretend we're
human fantasy game together.

299
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.924
All right. Let's play.

300
00:12:52.925 --> 00:12:54.059
You're human.

301
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.293
5 years from now, where are you?

302
00:12:55.294 --> 00:12:56.794
Easy. With you.

303
00:12:56.796 --> 00:12:59.164
Boring.
I'll need a zip code.

304
00:12:59.165 --> 00:13:01.600
Ok. Uh, in a loft in Tribeca

305
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:03.601
above the bar that you work at.

306
00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:06.671
You made me Matt Donovan
in your fantasy?

307
00:13:06.672 --> 00:13:09.373
Ok. You... you own the bar,

308
00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:11.910
and when you're
not working there,

309
00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:13.912
you're... you're on our couch,

310
00:13:13.913 --> 00:13:15.847
pouring me wine
and massaging my feet

311
00:13:15.848 --> 00:13:18.650
after a long day at the O.R.

312
00:13:18.651 --> 00:13:21.286
I'm in the surgical
residency program.

313
00:13:21.287 --> 00:13:23.788
Of course you are.

314
00:13:23.789 --> 00:13:24.789
Kids?

315
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.292
Yeah, of course, eventually,

316
00:13:27.293 --> 00:13:29.193
but we should, um,
probably have two,

317
00:13:29.194 --> 00:13:32.163
you know, so they can
keep each other company

318
00:13:32.164 --> 00:13:36.434
when we're, you know, distracted
by other things.

319
00:13:36.435 --> 00:13:37.934
Hmm.

320
00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:46.043
You got it all
figured out, don't you?

321
00:13:46.044 --> 00:13:47.545
How about you?
Your turn.

322
00:13:47.546 --> 00:13:50.915
5 years from now, where are you?

323
00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:51.916
Um...

324
00:13:51.917 --> 00:13:55.219
Ugh!
This is torture!

325
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.121
Sounds like the rats
are restless.

326
00:13:57.122 --> 00:14:00.925
Ugh. Like, actual torture.

327
00:14:00.926 --> 00:14:05.129
Elena and Damon talking
about their future together.

328
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.232
Echh. Just... I want to die.

329
00:14:08.233 --> 00:14:09.934
They'll make
a mistake eventually,

330
00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:12.236
and when they do, we will pounce

331
00:14:12.237 --> 00:14:13.571
and drain the first person

332
00:14:13.572 --> 00:14:15.239
we can get our teeth on.

333
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.740
Oh, my God.
What I would do

334
00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:20.377
for just a sip of human blood.

335
00:14:24.415 --> 00:14:27.885
You know when you're
feeding on someone's neck

336
00:14:27.886 --> 00:14:31.489
and their artery's
still pulsing?

337
00:14:33.024 --> 00:14:35.224
I really love that.

338
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.331
I thought your veins
felt like sandpaper.

339
00:14:41.332 --> 00:14:43.634
They do.

340
00:14:43.635 --> 00:14:45.868
So take my mind off it.

341
00:14:59.016 --> 00:15:00.050
Bored yet?

342
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:01.451
Go away, Damon.

343
00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:03.053
Brought you some
real light reading

344
00:15:03.054 --> 00:15:04.687
from the true crime section.

345
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.725
Curious...
which one of you idiots

346
00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:10.493
attacked a stadium
security guard

347
00:15:10.495 --> 00:15:12.496
and stuffed him
in a laundry cart?

348
00:15:12.497 --> 00:15:14.064
That would have
been me.

349
00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:15.866
Nice technique,

350
00:15:15.867 --> 00:15:17.367
although it's probably
good that your mom's gone

351
00:15:17.368 --> 00:15:19.202
because that would have
been a hell of a cover-up.

352
00:15:19.203 --> 00:15:20.871
Why are you only picking on me?

353
00:15:20.872 --> 00:15:24.140
Stefan's in here, too.
Annoy him.

354
00:15:24.142 --> 00:15:25.709
Because Stefan didn't
snap a barback's

355
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.543
clavicle in half.

356
00:15:27.545 --> 00:15:29.211
You know, it's really
quite sad actually.

357
00:15:29.213 --> 00:15:30.580
I can see Liz right now,

358
00:15:30.581 --> 00:15:32.482
calling the parents,
breaking the news,

359
00:15:32.483 --> 00:15:34.985
wondering where
she went wrong as a mother.

360
00:15:34.986 --> 00:15:36.987
She got cancer, Damon.

361
00:15:36.988 --> 00:15:38.555
That is where she went wrong.

362
00:15:38.556 --> 00:15:41.224
Oh! Blame her.

363
00:15:41.225 --> 00:15:43.026
Healthy attitude, Caroline.

364
00:15:43.027 --> 00:15:44.227
You know what?
You're right.

365
00:15:44.228 --> 00:15:46.696
I should really
just be more like

366
00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:48.164
you and Elena,

367
00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:49.666
just play make-believe
about the future

368
00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:51.568
that I can't have

369
00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:53.770
because that's healthy.

370
00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:56.706
Maybe I'll pretend I can
actually give birth to babies

371
00:15:56.707 --> 00:15:59.576
and have a normal family,

372
00:15:59.577 --> 00:16:02.345
and I can get a job
without having to move

373
00:16:02.346 --> 00:16:05.014
and start over every 5 years.

374
00:16:05.015 --> 00:16:06.516
I can operate on my patients

375
00:16:06.517 --> 00:16:08.251
without wanting to feed on them.

376
00:16:08.252 --> 00:16:10.153
You're a real bitch
when you're hungry.

377
00:16:10.154 --> 00:16:12.021
I'm curious, Damon.

378
00:16:12.022 --> 00:16:13.489
How does it feel to know

379
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.624
that you can't give
someone the life

380
00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:15.924
that she really wants?

381
00:16:15.926 --> 00:16:17.593
Shut up, Caroline.

382
00:16:17.594 --> 00:16:20.128
I'm just stating
the facts, Elena.

383
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.832
You didn't want this life.

384
00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:26.802
You can play fantasy
land all you want,

385
00:16:26.803 --> 00:16:29.771
but in this life,
the one where you're a vampire,

386
00:16:29.773 --> 00:16:31.373
you'll always be settling,

387
00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:35.311
and it's just so sad.

388
00:16:35.312 --> 00:16:36.512
- I can't listen to this.
- Elena.

389
00:16:36.513 --> 00:16:38.313
I don't want to hear it, ok?

390
00:16:46.288 --> 00:16:51.127
Uh... may I please
have a chicken sandwich

391
00:16:51.128 --> 00:16:53.095
and a bowl of soup?

392
00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:54.296
You bet, and that comes

393
00:16:54.297 --> 00:16:56.432
with a side of fries or skins.

394
00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.969
Um, I'm sorry.
Did you say skins?

395
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.505
I... I'm afraid I don't
know what that is.

396
00:17:02.506 --> 00:17:06.141
Neither, thanks,
and I'm not eating.

397
00:17:06.142 --> 00:17:07.810
Heh.

398
00:17:07.811 --> 00:17:09.178
That was painful.

399
00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:10.479
What's the matter?
Your all-blood diet

400
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.914
make you forget
how restaurants work?

401
00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:13.949
My first time actually.

402
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.752
How did I do?
Was I a blithering idiot?

403
00:17:16.753 --> 00:17:18.020
What are you talking about?

404
00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:19.521
Oh, I figured you were aware.

405
00:17:19.522 --> 00:17:22.791
I've been imprisoned
for the last 100 years.

406
00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.492
That old chestnut.

407
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:27.963
Lily, you turned me and left me

408
00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:31.400
on a passenger ship
full of headless corpses.

409
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:32.534
Wouldn't it be easier
to say you forgot

410
00:17:32.535 --> 00:17:33.835
what cabin number I was in?

411
00:17:33.836 --> 00:17:35.871
If only that were the case.

412
00:17:35.872 --> 00:17:37.606
No. The night I turned you,

413
00:17:37.607 --> 00:17:40.763
my friends and I were captured
by the Gemini coven.

414
00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:46.181
Oh, I see.

415
00:17:46.182 --> 00:17:49.183
All this time, you thought
that I abandoned you.

416
00:17:53.325 --> 00:17:55.356
I would never do that, Lorenzo.

417
00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:02.998
I will thank you not to mention

418
00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:05.533
headless corpses again.

419
00:18:05.534 --> 00:18:07.535
Those habits are all
in the past.

420
00:18:07.536 --> 00:18:10.771
At least it gives you and Stefan
something to bond over.

421
00:18:14.681 --> 00:18:18.213
Or maybe not.

422
00:18:18.214 --> 00:18:21.049
It's not their fault,

423
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.385
but they remind me of
a very dark time in my life.

424
00:18:23.386 --> 00:18:26.287
Not one for the maternal
instincts, I see.

425
00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:28.423
On the contrary.

426
00:18:28.424 --> 00:18:30.658
They were directed elsewhere.

427
00:18:30.659 --> 00:18:32.627
You see, I was trapped
in that prison world

428
00:18:32.628 --> 00:18:35.330
with 6 others,

429
00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:38.600
caring for them as we starved,

430
00:18:38.601 --> 00:18:41.069
surviving on two drops
of blood a week

431
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.638
just to preserve our rations.

432
00:18:43.639 --> 00:18:46.007
Sounds like a chore.

433
00:18:46.008 --> 00:18:48.709
Loyalty is never
a chore, Lorenzo.

434
00:18:51.446 --> 00:18:53.548
At any rate, it's ill-bred

435
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:56.451
to speak of such
personal matters.

436
00:18:56.452 --> 00:18:58.019
I do hope you're hungry.

437
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.922
It... it appears my lunch
date has stood me up...

438
00:19:00.923 --> 00:19:02.924
Bonnie Bennett.

439
00:19:02.925 --> 00:19:04.592
You see, my traveling companions

440
00:19:04.593 --> 00:19:07.695
remain trapped
in that prison world.

441
00:19:07.696 --> 00:19:09.797
Miss Bennett has offered
to get them out.

442
00:19:09.798 --> 00:19:11.565
Oh, has she now?

443
00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:48.369
Still looking.

444
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.602
She's gone.

445
00:19:49.604 --> 00:19:51.472
I told you to stall her.

446
00:19:51.473 --> 00:19:52.506
I couldn't.
She was with Enzo.

447
00:19:52.507 --> 00:19:53.874
When did they leave?

448
00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:55.409
I don't know,
but you better hurry up.

449
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.977
Do you know how many
places there are

450
00:19:56.978 --> 00:19:58.278
to hide things in this house?

451
00:19:58.279 --> 00:19:59.846
So kind of you
to bring me home.

452
00:19:59.848 --> 00:20:01.448
Bonnie, are you ok?

453
00:20:01.449 --> 00:20:02.883
Still, I think
you're wrong to worry

454
00:20:02.884 --> 00:20:04.618
about the ascendant.

455
00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:06.519
Damon assured me
all would be well.

456
00:20:07.955 --> 00:20:10.456
You've got a lot
to learn about your son.

457
00:20:10.458 --> 00:20:12.726
What do you mean by that?

458
00:20:12.727 --> 00:20:15.461
Eh, he's not the most
trustworthy chap.

459
00:20:16.964 --> 00:20:20.167
Figured you were aware.

460
00:20:20.168 --> 00:20:24.104
Is this entertaining to you...

461
00:20:24.105 --> 00:20:26.873
That the ascendant
has been taken from me,

462
00:20:26.874 --> 00:20:29.576
that I've lost the only
means of rescuing my family?

463
00:20:29.577 --> 00:20:30.943
Your family?

464
00:20:30.945 --> 00:20:33.747
You know what I am, Lorenzo.

465
00:20:33.748 --> 00:20:35.215
You saw the horror

466
00:20:35.216 --> 00:20:37.551
on that ship.

467
00:20:37.552 --> 00:20:38.952
The people in
that prison world are

468
00:20:38.953 --> 00:20:40.720
the only thing that keep me

469
00:20:40.721 --> 00:20:42.621
from becoming
that monster again.

470
00:20:42.623 --> 00:20:44.424
Your real family is right here

471
00:20:44.425 --> 00:20:47.227
in this house.

472
00:20:47.228 --> 00:20:48.661
Get out.

473
00:20:48.663 --> 00:20:49.896
Lily, relax.

474
00:20:49.897 --> 00:20:51.664
I said get out!

475
00:21:04.267 --> 00:21:05.845
Damon, Caroline's not right.

476
00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:07.033
I'm not settling.

477
00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:10.007
- But you do want to be human.
- You said it yourself.

478
00:21:10.008 --> 00:21:12.343
If I was human,
we wouldn't work.

479
00:21:12.344 --> 00:21:14.344
Exactly.
It wouldn't work.

480
00:21:14.346 --> 00:21:15.980
Human you chose Stefan.

481
00:21:15.981 --> 00:21:17.348
Why are you acting like this?

482
00:21:17.349 --> 00:21:19.316
Just admit what you
really want, Elena.

483
00:21:19.317 --> 00:21:21.217
What do you want me
to say, Damon?

484
00:21:21.219 --> 00:21:22.853
You want me to say
that I'm never gonna be

485
00:21:22.854 --> 00:21:25.823
100% ok with being a vampire
for the rest of eternity?

486
00:21:25.824 --> 00:21:30.461
Fine, but I'm ok with that

487
00:21:30.462 --> 00:21:34.231
because then that means
I get to be with you forever,

488
00:21:34.232 --> 00:21:36.867
and just the thought of
that is good enough for me.

489
00:21:36.868 --> 00:21:39.703
Why isn't it
good enough for you?

490
00:21:44.476 --> 00:21:46.777
Oh, good.
Mommy dearest.

491
00:21:46.778 --> 00:21:48.510
I'll let you take that.

492
00:21:51.748 --> 00:21:53.584
This better be a pocket dial.

493
00:21:53.585 --> 00:21:55.017
Where have you been?

494
00:21:55.019 --> 00:21:56.053
What are you...
My mother?

495
00:21:56.054 --> 00:21:57.421
Is it with you?

496
00:21:57.422 --> 00:21:58.622
Is what with me?

497
00:21:58.623 --> 00:21:59.890
The ascendant.

498
00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:01.191
It's not where I left it,

499
00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:02.426
and I very much doubt
the housekeeper took it.

500
00:22:02.427 --> 00:22:04.328
Maybe you misplaced it.

501
00:22:04.329 --> 00:22:07.564
It is the only thing
that can get my people back.

502
00:22:07.565 --> 00:22:09.766
I did not misplace it.

503
00:22:09.767 --> 00:22:11.034
Well, I don't have it,

504
00:22:11.035 --> 00:22:12.836
so start pulling up
pillow cushions.

505
00:22:12.837 --> 00:22:14.571
You have not heard me, son.

506
00:22:14.572 --> 00:22:16.333
I need it back.

507
00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:17.550
It's really not
a priority on my list

508
00:22:17.551 --> 00:22:19.432
of problems right now, mother.

509
00:22:20.411 --> 00:22:21.844
Find it,

510
00:22:21.846 --> 00:22:24.447
or rest assured,
I can just as easily destroy

511
00:22:24.448 --> 00:22:27.383
something of great
significance to you.

512
00:22:30.487 --> 00:22:32.455
Tucked inside a shoebox.

513
00:22:32.456 --> 00:22:35.592
Clearly you've learned the art
of hiding from your mother.

514
00:22:35.593 --> 00:22:36.960
You wouldn't do that.

515
00:22:36.961 --> 00:22:39.195
Bring me the ascendant,

516
00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:41.564
or I will crush
the cure to vampirism

517
00:22:41.565 --> 00:22:43.465
with my own hand.

518
00:22:47.004 --> 00:22:50.273
Ugh. It's like
a million degrees in here.

519
00:22:50.274 --> 00:22:53.243
Tell me about it.

520
00:22:53.244 --> 00:22:55.211
He speaks.

521
00:22:55.212 --> 00:22:56.913
You were so quiet
earlier when I was

522
00:22:56.914 --> 00:22:58.789
tearing into Elena.

523
00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.451
I was scared you were
feeling sad for her.

524
00:23:01.452 --> 00:23:06.189
No. It was just hard to
get a word in, that's all.

525
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:11.127
Ohh. Much better.

526
00:23:11.128 --> 00:23:12.828
I highly recommend it.

527
00:23:16.265 --> 00:23:19.572
I'm good.
Thank you.

528
00:23:20.503 --> 00:23:23.306
Are you sure?

529
00:23:23.307 --> 00:23:25.707
Because I can give you
a hand if you want.

530
00:23:29.445 --> 00:23:32.048
I said I'm good.

531
00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:33.657
I heard you.

532
00:23:36.452 --> 00:23:39.388
You know what else I hear?

533
00:23:39.389 --> 00:23:41.257
Your heart,

534
00:23:41.258 --> 00:23:43.856
and it's racing.

535
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.097
Am I making you nervous?

536
00:23:48.752 --> 00:23:50.766
Caroline.

537
00:23:50.767 --> 00:23:52.935
When did you flip it back?

538
00:23:52.936 --> 00:23:55.572
Heh. What are you talking about?

539
00:23:55.573 --> 00:23:58.140
Your humanity's been back on
this whole time, hasn't it?

540
00:23:58.141 --> 00:24:00.743
Damon and Elena knew
where to find us

541
00:24:00.744 --> 00:24:02.545
because you told them,

542
00:24:02.546 --> 00:24:04.313
and that's why
they were only picking on me.

543
00:24:04.314 --> 00:24:05.948
You must be having heatstroke.

544
00:24:05.949 --> 00:24:08.684
How dumb do you
think I am, Stefan?

545
00:24:08.685 --> 00:24:10.553
A few days ago,
you tore my clothes off.

546
00:24:10.554 --> 00:24:12.788
Now you don't even
want to kiss me?

547
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:14.589
What's wrong, hmm?

548
00:24:16.759 --> 00:24:20.195
What, you don't want
to take advantage of me?

549
00:24:20.196 --> 00:24:24.233
You don't want to ruin
our nonexistent relationship?

550
00:24:24.234 --> 00:24:27.069
Please stop.

551
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.704
Relax, Stefan.

552
00:24:29.706 --> 00:24:32.441
I don't really feel like
kissing anymore.

553
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.179
Incendia.

554
00:25:13.308 --> 00:25:16.343
Phesmatos de strutos
avox addellum.

555
00:25:17.445 --> 00:25:19.880
Do not take another step.

556
00:25:19.882 --> 00:25:22.050
You don't know what
you're doing, Bonnie.

557
00:25:22.051 --> 00:25:24.552
I know exactly what I'm doing.

558
00:25:24.553 --> 00:25:26.821
I'm protecting myself.

559
00:25:26.822 --> 00:25:29.023
For the first time,
I'm putting me first.

560
00:25:29.024 --> 00:25:30.658
Look. I'm all about girl power,

561
00:25:30.659 --> 00:25:32.193
but just give me
the damn ascendant,

562
00:25:32.194 --> 00:25:34.929
and I promise you
Kai will not get out.

563
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.464
Oh. You promise me?

564
00:25:36.465 --> 00:25:38.366
Is that supposed
to mean something?

565
00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:40.066
This isn't about Kai anymore.

566
00:25:40.068 --> 00:25:41.636
The people
that that this would free

567
00:25:41.637 --> 00:25:43.670
are a million times
stronger than him and us,

568
00:25:43.672 --> 00:25:45.039
and don't get me
started on the fun

569
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.007
they would have with
a newly human Elena.

570
00:25:47.009 --> 00:25:49.076
My mom has the cure, Bonnie.

571
00:25:49.077 --> 00:25:51.245
What are you talking about?

572
00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:52.879
If I don't bring her that,
she's gonna destroy it.

573
00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:55.982
So your own mother
is leveraging you?

574
00:25:55.984 --> 00:25:58.585
Guess the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

575
00:26:00.588 --> 00:26:04.023
Phesmatos de strutos
avox addellum.

576
00:26:06.193 --> 00:26:07.861
Stop!

577
00:26:07.862 --> 00:26:11.332
Unh! Ohh!

578
00:26:11.333 --> 00:26:13.167
If I hand this over to you,

579
00:26:13.168 --> 00:26:15.135
I am sacrificing myself again,

580
00:26:15.136 --> 00:26:17.338
I'm risking my life again.

581
00:26:17.339 --> 00:26:19.440
I could end up dead again!

582
00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:21.408
You don't want to
push me, Bon Bon.

583
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:23.577
What do you want,
for Elena to have a human life,

584
00:26:23.578 --> 00:26:26.479
to be happy,
to grow old without you?

585
00:26:26.481 --> 00:26:28.048
If that's what you
really wanted,

586
00:26:28.049 --> 00:26:30.983
you would have given
her the cure by now.

587
00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:34.188
Am I wrong?

588
00:26:34.189 --> 00:26:36.757
I said, "am I wrong?"

589
00:26:36.758 --> 00:26:37.925
I know you, Damon.

590
00:26:37.926 --> 00:26:41.023
I spent 4 months with you,

591
00:26:42.098 --> 00:26:44.759
day in and day out.

592
00:26:45.566 --> 00:26:50.837
We went to hell
and back again literally,

593
00:26:50.838 --> 00:26:52.772
and you're more scared now

594
00:26:52.774 --> 00:26:56.676
than I have ever
seen you before.

595
00:26:56.677 --> 00:26:57.911
It's not about what happens

596
00:26:57.912 --> 00:27:01.414
if you don't give
Elena the cure.

597
00:27:01.415 --> 00:27:03.916
You're scared about
what happens if you do.

598
00:27:11.124 --> 00:27:12.726
If you think you can handle it,

599
00:27:12.727 --> 00:27:14.761
free a bunch of people
who will want to kill me

600
00:27:14.762 --> 00:27:16.963
and anyone else who tries
to stand in their way,

601
00:27:16.964 --> 00:27:19.132
and then you can spend
the next 70 years

602
00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:23.336
watching Elena grow old and die.

603
00:27:23.337 --> 00:27:25.472
If that's what you want,

604
00:27:25.473 --> 00:27:26.837
take it.

605
00:27:56.869 --> 00:27:59.305
Oh, thank God.

606
00:27:59.306 --> 00:28:01.006
Snack time.

607
00:28:17.223 --> 00:28:18.724
Step out of the car.

608
00:28:18.725 --> 00:28:20.326
Mom, what are you...

609
00:28:20.327 --> 00:28:21.993
I said get out of the car.

610
00:28:27.522 --> 00:28:29.135
You're under arrest
for the murders

611
00:28:29.136 --> 00:28:30.736
of Chris Benton, Jason Hughes...

612
00:28:30.737 --> 00:28:33.072
Mom, it's me.
It's Caroline.

613
00:28:33.073 --> 00:28:34.273
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

614
00:28:34.274 --> 00:28:35.841
My daughter's kind,
compassionate.

615
00:28:35.842 --> 00:28:37.309
She looks after those in need.

616
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.044
You're not real.
You can't be real.

617
00:28:39.045 --> 00:28:41.280
I raised my daughter
to be a good person.

618
00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:42.814
Stop! I know what you're doing.

619
00:28:42.816 --> 00:28:44.550
And she knows how hurt
I would be to see her this way.

620
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:45.783
Shut up! Stop!

621
00:28:45.785 --> 00:28:47.019
You can't be here.

622
00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.287
You are not my daughter!

623
00:28:48.288 --> 00:28:50.356
I know what you're
doing to me, Stefan.

624
00:28:50.357 --> 00:28:52.758
My mom died.
She's dead.

625
00:28:52.759 --> 00:28:55.294
This isn't real.

626
00:28:57.564 --> 00:28:58.931
It's working.

627
00:28:58.932 --> 00:29:00.733
The pain you're feeling,
let it in.

628
00:29:00.734 --> 00:29:03.402
Starve me, bleed me out,

629
00:29:03.403 --> 00:29:04.903
put visions in my head?

630
00:29:04.904 --> 00:29:06.105
That was your plan all along?

631
00:29:06.106 --> 00:29:07.573
You need to come back
now, Caroline.

632
00:29:07.574 --> 00:29:08.874
Just get away from me.

633
00:29:08.875 --> 00:29:10.108
I want to show you something.

634
00:29:10.109 --> 00:29:11.143
Just take my hand.

635
00:29:11.144 --> 00:29:12.945
Unh!

636
00:29:12.946 --> 00:29:15.447
I said get away from me.

637
00:29:15.448 --> 00:29:17.449
I can help you if you let me.

638
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.670
Just please take my hand.

639
00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:24.121
Please, Caroline.

640
00:29:39.157 --> 00:29:40.906
Unh!

641
00:29:40.907 --> 00:29:42.974
I don't want your help, Stefan.

642
00:29:42.975 --> 00:29:45.075
I just want you to die.

643
00:29:51.563 --> 00:29:53.527
Your heart's racing
again, Stefan.

644
00:29:53.528 --> 00:29:55.329
Let me fix that.

645
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.397
Agh!

646
00:29:56.398 --> 00:29:58.198
Caroline, please stop.

647
00:30:10.444 --> 00:30:12.713
Ok.

648
00:30:12.714 --> 00:30:14.815
Needle and thread as requested.

649
00:30:14.816 --> 00:30:16.684
Do I want to know why
you suddenly decided

650
00:30:16.685 --> 00:30:18.018
to take up sewing?

651
00:30:18.019 --> 00:30:20.554
Heh. Well, Caroline and I spent

652
00:30:20.555 --> 00:30:22.656
the entire day digging in
the woods to find a Teddy bear,

653
00:30:22.657 --> 00:30:25.059
and now she wants to repair it.

654
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.594
She's very task-oriented.

655
00:30:27.595 --> 00:30:28.993
Yes, I am aware.

656
00:30:31.032 --> 00:30:32.870
What the hell is this?

657
00:30:32.871 --> 00:30:36.449
It... it's a memory, a real one.

658
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.238
Thank you.

659
00:30:38.239 --> 00:30:40.007
You, uh, should have
seen the look

660
00:30:40.008 --> 00:30:42.910
on Caroline's face when
that bear fell apart.

661
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:44.443
You're a good friend
to her, Stefan.

662
00:30:44.445 --> 00:30:48.167
I hope someday
you'll be more than that.

663
00:30:49.317 --> 00:30:50.584
I'm dying.

664
00:30:50.585 --> 00:30:53.120
I'm allowed to be blunt.

665
00:30:53.121 --> 00:30:54.421
It's a time saver.

666
00:30:54.422 --> 00:30:56.356
Well, I don't think
the timing is right

667
00:30:56.357 --> 00:30:58.725
for me and Caroline right now

668
00:30:58.726 --> 00:31:01.427
with everything going on.

669
00:31:01.429 --> 00:31:03.296
Oh, blame me, why don't you?

670
00:31:03.297 --> 00:31:05.465
No. I just mean if I'm gonna
start something with Caroline,

671
00:31:05.466 --> 00:31:08.068
I want it to be perfect...

672
00:31:08.069 --> 00:31:12.706
No loss, no pain, no grief.

673
00:31:12.707 --> 00:31:15.642
You might be waiting a while.

674
00:31:15.643 --> 00:31:17.243
I'm a patient guy.

675
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.649
Hey. Do you want me to
mail that out for you?

676
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.319
Oh. No, thanks.
I'm still working on it.

677
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.654
I'll mail it out tomorrow.

678
00:31:27.655 --> 00:31:30.056
I have an idea
of what I want to say.

679
00:31:30.057 --> 00:31:31.361
It's just...

680
00:31:32.459 --> 00:31:35.152
I guess I want it
to be perfect, too.

681
00:31:35.153 --> 00:31:37.864
You're a good mom.

682
00:31:37.865 --> 00:31:39.032
I hope so.

683
00:31:43.403 --> 00:31:46.172
I want to see the rest.

684
00:31:46.173 --> 00:31:47.873
Let me see her!

685
00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:52.111
Wait, wait.

686
00:31:52.112 --> 00:31:53.512
Mom!

687
00:31:54.542 --> 00:31:58.151
Mom! It's me!
It's Caroline.

688
00:31:58.152 --> 00:31:59.852
Just come outside.

689
00:31:59.853 --> 00:32:01.988
I want to talk to you.

690
00:32:01.989 --> 00:32:04.322
I want to read your letter!

691
00:32:08.027 --> 00:32:09.996
Please. Mommy!

692
00:32:12.199 --> 00:32:14.734
Mom, please.

693
00:32:14.735 --> 00:32:17.637
Come back.

694
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.776
Make her come back.

695
00:32:23.777 --> 00:32:24.977
I can't.

696
00:32:24.978 --> 00:32:27.480
No. Just show me
the vision again, ok?

697
00:32:27.481 --> 00:32:29.682
I... I want to see
my mom, Stefan.

698
00:32:29.683 --> 00:32:31.284
I... I need to know what
she said in that letter.

699
00:32:31.285 --> 00:32:34.386
- I already gave you the letter.
- No.

700
00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:38.224
No.

701
00:32:38.225 --> 00:32:39.891
No!

702
00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:46.788
What do you think
she wanted to tell me?

703
00:32:47.467 --> 00:32:49.534
Whatever it was, it's gone.

704
00:32:53.283 --> 00:32:55.406
No.

705
00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:57.509
I did this.

706
00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.245
This is all my fault.

707
00:32:59.246 --> 00:33:02.181
No.

708
00:33:02.182 --> 00:33:03.916
I tried to kill you,

709
00:33:03.917 --> 00:33:05.751
and then I made you turn it off,

710
00:33:05.752 --> 00:33:07.686
and then we...
Oh, my God.

711
00:33:07.687 --> 00:33:08.654
It's ok, Caroline.
It's ok.

712
00:33:08.655 --> 00:33:10.723
I'm so sorry, Stefan.

713
00:33:10.724 --> 00:33:11.990
I ruined everything.

714
00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:14.859
I ruined everything.

715
00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:26.305
Tell me you have the ascendant.

716
00:33:26.306 --> 00:33:29.608
I can't, because I don't.

717
00:33:29.609 --> 00:33:32.177
Then you understand what's
going to happen next.

718
00:33:32.178 --> 00:33:34.246
Oh, it will just be
like old times.

719
00:33:34.247 --> 00:33:38.283
I screw up,
and you punish me for it.

720
00:33:38.284 --> 00:33:39.917
Some things never change.

721
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:46.958
Spare me your indignation.

722
00:33:46.959 --> 00:33:49.428
We both know I did you a favor.

723
00:33:49.429 --> 00:33:51.963
That sense of relief
you feel right now,

724
00:33:51.964 --> 00:33:53.565
that's the realization

725
00:33:53.566 --> 00:33:55.232
that Elena will never leave you.

726
00:34:04.943 --> 00:34:06.845
You made her choice for her.

727
00:34:06.846 --> 00:34:08.480
There's no harm in that.

728
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:10.281
As long as you're happy,

729
00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:12.128
she never needs to know.

730
00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:30.101
Although wait a minute.

731
00:34:30.102 --> 00:34:34.305
Making Elena yours forever,

732
00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:37.342
that's exactly what you want.

733
00:34:37.343 --> 00:34:39.476
That wouldn't be
a punishment at all.

734
00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:43.880
Damon!

735
00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:47.752
Damon, is this...

736
00:34:47.753 --> 00:34:50.288
The cure to vampirism.

737
00:34:50.289 --> 00:34:52.557
I left it out for you to find

738
00:34:52.558 --> 00:34:55.291
since Damon was never
going to offer it to you.

739
00:34:57.629 --> 00:34:59.330
Is that true?

740
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:01.566
Elena, I can explain.

741
00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:03.680
Looks like you two have
a lot to talk about.

742
00:35:13.808 --> 00:35:15.209
Ahh.

743
00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:19.737
How is she?

744
00:35:22.792 --> 00:35:24.519
What are you doing?

745
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.189
I am going home for
a shower and a stiff drink.

746
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.891
What about Caroline?

747
00:35:29.892 --> 00:35:31.392
She doesn't want to see me.

748
00:35:31.393 --> 00:35:33.728
Stefan, every emotion
she's been pushing away

749
00:35:33.729 --> 00:35:35.597
just came racing back
at a 100 miles an hour.

750
00:35:35.598 --> 00:35:37.232
Yeah. I don't need
a lesson on how

751
00:35:37.233 --> 00:35:40.168
the humanity switch works, Ric.

752
00:35:40.169 --> 00:35:41.436
Trust me. She doesn't
want to see me.

753
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.890
Maybe you should let Caroline
decide what she needs.

754
00:36:40.461 --> 00:36:42.596
Hey.

755
00:36:42.597 --> 00:36:45.065
Hey.

756
00:36:45.066 --> 00:36:48.335
- Caroline...
- Don't.

757
00:36:48.336 --> 00:36:50.771
Don't.

758
00:36:50.772 --> 00:36:52.206
You ok?

759
00:36:52.207 --> 00:36:55.476
How can I be ok after everything

760
00:36:55.477 --> 00:36:57.978
that I ruined?

761
00:36:57.979 --> 00:36:59.980
Just don't worry about me.

762
00:36:59.981 --> 00:37:04.151
I'm not gonna turn it off again,

763
00:37:04.152 --> 00:37:11.014
but you... and...
Us...

764
00:37:12.217 --> 00:37:13.659
This...

765
00:37:19.666 --> 00:37:22.535
I just really need
to get out of here.

766
00:37:45.725 --> 00:37:47.326
You came.

767
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:54.434
In 1903, I was sick.

768
00:37:54.435 --> 00:37:57.370
My own family had abandoned me,

769
00:37:57.371 --> 00:37:58.538
and you took me under your wing

770
00:37:58.539 --> 00:38:00.959
and rescued me from death.

771
00:38:02.275 --> 00:38:05.044
As it turns out,
loyalty is important to me, too.

772
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.483
They make cars so quiet now.

773
00:38:10.484 --> 00:38:14.154
One hardly hears them coming.

774
00:38:14.155 --> 00:38:17.157
I was out for a walk
to clear my head.

775
00:38:17.158 --> 00:38:19.792
I very nearly
caused an accident.

776
00:38:19.793 --> 00:38:21.961
I apologized of course,

777
00:38:21.962 --> 00:38:24.998
but I'd given
the driver quite a shock

778
00:38:24.999 --> 00:38:28.166
by walking in front of his car.

779
00:38:28.168 --> 00:38:29.969
His heart was
beating like a drum.

780
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.205
I could see
the pulse in his neck,

781
00:38:32.206 --> 00:38:35.433
and in that moment,
I forgot all my troubles.

782
00:38:38.678 --> 00:38:41.681
I felt no pain,

783
00:38:41.682 --> 00:38:46.518
no despair, no loneliness.

784
00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.432
I fear it got the best of me.

785
00:39:17.983 --> 00:39:20.052
What have I done?

786
00:39:21.988 --> 00:39:25.190
What have I done?!

787
00:39:25.191 --> 00:39:26.651
It's ok.

788
00:39:30.095 --> 00:39:32.631
You're ok.

789
00:39:48.747 --> 00:39:51.049
So that whole
5 years from now game

790
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:54.118
and all that talk
about our future?

791
00:39:54.715 --> 00:39:58.168
Not so subtle
in hindsight, was it?

792
00:39:58.169 --> 00:40:02.261
I mean, I get it,
but if I take this,

793
00:40:02.262 --> 00:40:04.409
everything changes.

794
00:40:05.783 --> 00:40:08.633
I just never thought
I would see it again.

795
00:40:08.634 --> 00:40:10.936
That makes two of us.

796
00:40:10.937 --> 00:40:13.504
My mother threatened
to destroy that today...

797
00:40:15.874 --> 00:40:19.945
- And I didn't stop her.
- Why not?

798
00:40:19.946 --> 00:40:23.428
Because your fantasy of 5 years
from now scared the hell out of me.

799
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:26.032
I panicked.

800
00:40:26.033 --> 00:40:28.466
Damon, it was just
a stupid game.

801
00:40:29.017 --> 00:40:31.692
All I see in 5 years
from now is you.

802
00:40:32.201 --> 00:40:34.025
You see your entire future,

803
00:40:34.026 --> 00:40:36.008
and I want you to have that.

804
00:40:36.009 --> 00:40:37.352
I want you to live in a big city

805
00:40:37.353 --> 00:40:39.196
and be a surgeon
and have a family.

806
00:40:39.198 --> 00:40:40.899
Then why would you
keep it a secret from me

807
00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.620
for so many days and then
try to have it destroyed?

808
00:40:43.621 --> 00:40:45.870
Because I'm an idiot
and I'm selfish

809
00:40:45.871 --> 00:40:48.039
and I'm so in love with you

810
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.494
and I don't want to lose you.

811
00:40:51.234 --> 00:40:54.345
It's just...

812
00:40:54.346 --> 00:40:56.146
It's just too complicated.

813
00:41:00.018 --> 00:41:02.173
We're gonna give it
to somebody else.

814
00:41:02.174 --> 00:41:05.055
Bonnie's mom or Caroline.

815
00:41:05.057 --> 00:41:06.591
Already tried to pawn it off.

816
00:41:06.592 --> 00:41:08.026
Fine. Then I'm sure
there's a long list

817
00:41:08.027 --> 00:41:10.061
of vampires
who would give anything

818
00:41:10.062 --> 00:41:11.362
for a do-over.

819
00:41:11.363 --> 00:41:13.030
You're gonna take
the cure, Elena.

820
00:41:13.032 --> 00:41:14.668
Well, I don't want it, Damon.

821
00:41:16.068 --> 00:41:17.902
I don't want to live
without you either.

822
00:41:17.903 --> 00:41:20.555
You're gonna take
the cure, Elena,

823
00:41:21.489 --> 00:41:24.242
and I'm gonna take it with you.

824
00:41:24.243 --> 00:41:25.709
What?!

825
00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:28.212
I don't want to face
my future without you.

826
00:41:28.213 --> 00:41:30.046
I'll become human, too.
